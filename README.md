# Hackathon_Project
2021 Microsoft Coding Project

#This is my coding project for the BAM Mentorship Program. My application is designed for startup businesses. It generates a color palette for the user based on the brand qualities they select. If there is no intersection where brand qualities can generate the same color, the user will be asked to pick a different set of descriptors. The application also allows the user to download the RGB number and displays an image of the various colors.
