# Hackathon_Project
2021 Microsoft Coding Project

This is my coding project for the BAM Mentorship Program. My application is designed for startup businesses. It generates three color palettes for the user based on the brand qualities they select. If there is no intersection where brand qualities can generate the same color, the user will be asked to pick a different set of descriptors. Furthermore, users can pick how many colors they would like in each color palette (1-3). Once these are selected, the application displays images of the color palette and allows the user to download the corresponding RGB numbers.
